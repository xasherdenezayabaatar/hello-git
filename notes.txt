My initial thoughts are that I am doing this at the last minute and am a bit ashamed of that.
Besides that I also wonder if learning the terminal commands are necessary,
because I can just clone a repo using VS Code's GUI so I don't see the point of this.

Summary: I'm late, and I wonder whether this is necessary to learn when I could just utilise VS Code's intuitive GUI.
